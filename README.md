Kicad generic digital schematic symbols

There symbols are intended for abstract logical designs so do not
necessarily correspond to real electronic parts.

Symbol bodies do not have pin extensions. Instead, the pins are on the
symbol body directly, so the negation bubble can be added separately
(via the "negation" symbol) and avoid a potential combinatorial
explosion of symbols with and without bubbles.

AND/OR/XOR distinctive symbol shapes are based on IEEE Std 91-1984
Annex A recommended symbol proportions quantized to the standard Kicad
0.050" grid. They are otherwise at the same scale as the Kicad 5
symbols.

The inverter symbol is scaled relative to the distinctive symbol shapes
to be similar to the Berol RapidDesign R-542 drawing template and other
classic hand drawn schematics of the 1970s and 1980s.
